Sales Data Analysis Dashboard in Excel
In this project, sample sales data was analysed using Microsoft Excel to provide a clear overview of business performance. A comprehensive dashboard was created to visually and interactively present key metrics.
Using PivotTables, the data was summarised to calculate:
Total units sold,
Average unit cost,
Total sales amount,
Sales and performance per representative,
Sales distribution by region,
Monthly sales trends.
To enhance data visualisation and interpretation, various chart types were used, including:
Line charts to illustrate monthly sales trends
Bar charts to compare performance among sales representatives and regions
Pie charts to show regional sales distribution
These elements were brought together into a user-friendly Excel dashboard, allowing stakeholders to quickly identify trends, top performers, and areas for improvement. The use of Excel functions, data validation, and dynamic charting made the dashboard interactive and efficient for decision-making.
